# Learning Git and GitHub

Short HTML page of repositories to learn git and github. You can find more details on Git Page (https://joaoaccorsi.github.io/learningGitHubRepositories/).

With this project build in Visual Studio Code, I was able to practice git flow, such as work with branches, etc.
Later on, I also synchronized the project with GitHub.

It was made as of Linkedin Learning curse "Learning Git and GitHub", by Ray Villalobos.
